            <h3>Where I'm From</h3>
            <p>I am from a small town called <strong>South Lyon</strong>, Michigan. Growing up I was about an hour away from <strong>Detriot</strong> as well as an hour away from <strong>Lansing</strong> which made my view of michigan very central.</p>

            <h3>What I'm Interested In</h3>
            <p>Ever since I was young, technology has always interested me. I constantly was opening radios, tv-remotes, and other small tech to see how it works. My love of computers started when I was about 10 years old and my parents let me do chores to earn an old laptop. This old laptop that barely ran Windows XP blew my mind and started my love for the magic that is technology in general.</p>

            <h3>What I'm Pursuing</h3>
            <p>Currently, I am aiming to finish my Senior year at Michigan State University for my degree in Information Science. I am also working for Michigan State Information Technology as a Student Network Engineer, and get to troublshoot networking problems on an enterprise scale. It is due to this opportunity, as well as my background in general IT at Geek Squad that I am pursuing network engineering as a career and plan to move in that direction moving forward. To help me along that path, I am currently studying for different certifications to allow me to learn more.</p>
