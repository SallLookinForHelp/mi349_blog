            <p>I am from a small town called <strong>South Lyon</strong>, Michigan. Growing up I was about an hour away from <strong>Detroit</strong> as well as an hour away from <strong>Lansing</strong>, which made my view of Michigan very central.</p>

            <h2 class="title-center">What I'm Interested In</h2>
            <p>Ever since I was young, technology has always interested me. I constantly opened radios, TV remotes, and other small devices to see how they worked. My love of computers started when I was about 10 years old, when my parents let me do chores to earn an old laptop. That old laptop, barely running Windows XP, sparked my love for technology and the magic behind it.</p>

            <h2 class="title-center">What I'm Pursuing</h2>
            <p>Currently, I am finishing my Senior year at Michigan State University, studying Information Science. I also work for Michigan State Information Technology as a Student Network Engineer, where I troubleshoot networking issues on an enterprise scale. Thanks to this experience—and my background at Geek Squad—I’m pursuing network engineering as my career path. To keep improving, I’m studying for certifications that strengthen my technical foundation.</p>
