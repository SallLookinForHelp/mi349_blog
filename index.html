            <p>I usually wake up around <em>5:45am</em> on my Tuesdays because I like to get ready for <a href="https://tech.msu.edu/">work</a>. I show, get dressed, and leave my apartment by <em>6:30am</em> for work.</p>

            <p>After arriving at the office, I drop my lunch off in the fridge and begin checking my tests that I left from the day before. Today I was testing an <strong>Access Point</strong> for a students room that was giving them trouble. I usually leave for class around <em>11:00am</em>.</p>
