            <p>After arriving at the office, I drop my lunch off in the fridge and begin checking my tests that I left from the day before. Today I was testing an <strong>Access Point</strong> for a student's room that was giving them trouble. I usually leave for class around <em>11:00am</em>. - Luke Sall</p>

                    <p>At work it isn't unusual that I have to either drive out to a location or work on something in the office. Due to this, it is important that I am constantly doing homework outside of work to balance this. To ensure that I have time for this, I found that going to work on days that I don't have class end up letting me do homework on my days off and create a better schedule for me.</p>
