            <p>I usually wake up around <em>5:45am</em> on my Tuesdays because I like to get ready for <a href="https://tech.msu.edu/">work</a>. I show, get dressed, and leave my apartment by <em>6:30am</em> for work.</p>

            <p>After arriving at the office, I drop my lunch off in the fridge and begin checking my tests that I left from the day before. Today I was testing an <strong>Access Point</strong> for a students room that was giving them trouble. I usually leave for class around <em>11:00am</em>.</p>

            <h3 class="Sub-Title">Time Management! - Luke Sall</h3>
                <p>At work it isn't unusual that I have to either drive out to a location or work on something in the office. Due to this, it is important that I am constantly doing homework outside of work to balance this. To ensure that I have time for this, I found that going to work on days that I don't have class end up letting me do homework on my days off and create a better schedule for me. Below is a table of how I manage my time througout the week.</p>
